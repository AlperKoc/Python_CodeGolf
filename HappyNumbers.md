# Check if a positive number N is happy or not.

- A number is called happy when repeatedly summing the square of its digits yields 1.

For example, if N=86, its digits are 8 and 6, and then:

86 => 8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100
100 => 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1

Therefore 86 is happy.

- Input

- Output
  - A sentence N IS HAPPY or N IS UNHAPPY
- Constraints
  - 0<N<10^20
